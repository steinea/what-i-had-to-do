**NEW YORK** – November 16, 2023 – Today, the [**New York Videogame Critics Circle**](https://nygamecritics.com/) (NYVGCC) announced that Neil Druckmann, co-president and head of creative at Naughty Dog, is the recipient of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award for the 13th annual New York Game Awards.  
  
Druckmann has a legendary 20-year career in the games industry, contributing to landmark titles in the _Uncharted_ series and transcending traditional gaming with the multimedia juggernaut in _The Last of Us_. Neil’s generational talents in game design, storytelling, and directing have earned him countless accolades and have cemented his status as an icon of game development history.  
  
“Neil Druckmann’s story is an inspirational one of self-determinism. He worked his way from an internship all the way up to being a co-president at Naughty Dog,” said Harold Goldberg, president and founder, NYVGCC. “His skill for creating titles that consistently redefine cinematic gameplay and human-centric storytelling not only deserves celebrating, but his efforts to create characters that represent diverse backgrounds and perspectives have enriched content in AAA games. His brilliant work has been lauded with multiple New York Game Awards over the year, and we are honored to recognize him as this year’s Andrew Yoon Legend Award winner.”  
  
“It’s an honor to have someone like Neil Druckmann as the Andrew Yoon Legend Award for my first New York Game Awards with NYVGCC,” said Ryan O’Callaghan, executive director, NYVGCC. “His creative vision has been monumental in pushing the games industry to captivate audiences through Naughty Dog’s expansive video game catalog and their film and TV adaptations. We look forward to presenting the Andrew Yoon Legend Award to Neil live and in-person as part of the 13th Annual New York Game Awards!”
