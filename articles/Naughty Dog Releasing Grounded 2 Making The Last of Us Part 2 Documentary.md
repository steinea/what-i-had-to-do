# Naughty Dog Releasing Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 Documentary

#### Coming to YouTube.

Naughty Dog is releasing a documentary called Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 as a sequel to its 2014 one based on the original game.

Announced in a post on X/Twitter, Naughty Dog didn't share a release date for the trailer but did announce it would be coming to YouTube and The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered in a post launch update, which at least suggests it won't be available when the game releases on January 19.

"Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 is coming," the post read. "It will be available on YouTube and as part of a post-launch update for The Last of Us Part 2."

A two minute trailer for the documentary was released too, showing development footage of the 2020 game dating as far back as 2016. Grounded 2 will give fans a look at the inside of Naughty Dog as the game was created, and the trailer shows off various key moments including when a huge leak revealed key story details ahead of launch. Various team members including director Neil Druckmann also appear in the trailer to offer insight into the development process.

Naughty Dog released the original Grounded documentary in 2014, which arrived as a similar 85 minute feature on the making of the original The Last of Us.

[The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-for-ps5-confirmed-for-january-2024) will likely be fans' next taste of the franchise when it arrives later in January. It includes a roguelike mode called No Return, Lost Levels with developer commentary, graphical enhancements, DualSense integration, and a Guitar Free Play mode.

The Lost Levels — which were cut from the original game but are being included as bonus content for the PlayStation 5 upgrade — are called Jackson Dance, Boar Hunt, and Sewers, [the last of which has fans particularly worried](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-lost-levels-revealed-and-fans-are-already-spooked).

In our [10/10 review of the original game](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review), IGN said: "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way."
