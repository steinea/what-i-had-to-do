# _The Last Of Us_ Season Two Casts _Dora The Explorer_ Actor As Dina

#### Isabela Merced starred in _Transformers: The Last Knight_ and will play Hawkgirl in the DCU

After two other consecutive casting announcements, Max and Naughty Dog have revealed that Isabela Merced will play Ellie’s girlfriend Dina in _The Last of Us_’ second season, which is set to premiere on the streaming service in 2025. Sorry to anyone who wanted it to be that girl we saw [staring at Ellie in that one scene in season one](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-dina-e6-who-is-paolina-van-kleef-tlou2-1850139823).  

Like [Abby](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428) and [Jesse](https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-jesse-actor-young-mazino-1851155868) before, the announcement rolled out first [on Max’s social channels](https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1745491012795896144) confirming Merced is joining the cast on January 11, followed by a [second post from _The Last of Us_ developer Naughty Dog](https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1745491149681517046) stating that she’s playing Dina.

Some of Merced’s notable acting credits include playing Dora in the live-action _Dora the Explorer_ film _Dora and the Lost City of Gold_, and Izabella in _Transformers: The Last Knight_. Later this year, she’ll appear in _Madame Web_ as Anya Corazon, and next year she’ll play Hawkgirl in _Superman: Legacy_. She’s recently done a lot of franchise work—so she’ll be somewhat comfortable in the world of _TLOU_.

During the first season, fans [thought Dina had already made an appearance in the show](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-dina-e6-who-is-paolina-van-kleef-tlou2-1850139823) after a young girl who kind of looked like her was shown staring at Ellie when she and Joel first arrived in the Jackson community. Whether it was meant to be her or not, the actor in the scene, Paolina van Kleef, is not playing Dina in season two.

If you’ve never played the games, Dina is easily one of the standout characters in _The Last of Us Part II_. She’s Ellie’s girlfriend, one of the most reliable sources of comic relief, and embodies some of the game’s larger themes in the eleventh hour. There are still a lot of characters in _The Last of Us Part II_ who have yet to have actors confirmed for the adaptation—but all we really want is for Max to announce that game actor Ian Alexander will step into the role of Lev again, this time for the TV series. Thank you.
