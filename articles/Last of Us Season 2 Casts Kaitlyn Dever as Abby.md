# ‘Last of Us’ Season 2 Casts Kaitlyn Dever as Abby

“[The Last of Us](https://variety.com/t/the-last-of-us/)” Season 2 has officially cast [Kaitlyn Dever](https://variety.com/t/kaitlyn-dever/), _Variety_ has learned.

Dever joins the hit [HBO](https://variety.com/t/hbo/) show in the role of Abby, who is described as “a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.”

“Our casting process for season two has been identical to season one: we look for world-class actors who embody the souls of the characters in the source material,” said series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann. “Nothing matters more than talent, and we’re thrilled to have an acclaimed performer like Kaitlyn join Pedro, Bella and the rest of our family.”

Dever’s past TV credits include shows like “Last Man Standing,” “Justified,””Unbelievable,” and “Dopesick.” On the film side, she has starred in features such as “Booksmart,” “Rosaline,” “Next Goal Wins,” and “No One Will Save You,” the last of which she also executive produced. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in “Unbelievable” and a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for “Dopesick.”

She is repped by UTA and Felker Toczek.

“The Last of Us” is based on the hit video game of the same name created by Druckmann and developed by Naughty Dog. The official description states “the story takes place twenty years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey, as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.”

The cast for Season 1 also included Gabriel Luna, Anna Torv, Nico Parker, Murray Bartlett, Nick Offerman, Melanie Lynskey, Storm Reid, Merle Dandridge, Jeffrey Pierce, Lamar Johnson, Keivonn Woodard, Graham Greene, Elaine Miles, Ashley Johnson, and Troy Baker.

The series is written and executive produced by Mazin and Druckmann. Both have also directed episodes of the show. Carolyn Strauss and Evan Wells, president of Naughty Dog, executive produce with PlayStation Productions’ Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan as well as Rose Lam. The series is a co-production between HBO and Sony Pictures Television. PlayStation Productions, Word Games, The Mighty Mint, and Naughty Dog produce.

“The Last of Us” proved to be a massive hit with both critics and audiences. In addition to [stellar viewership](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-1-finale-ratings-viewers-1235551465/#:~:text=Popular%20on%20Variety,ABC's%20telecast%20of%20the%20Oscars.), the show received multiple awards nominations for its first season.
