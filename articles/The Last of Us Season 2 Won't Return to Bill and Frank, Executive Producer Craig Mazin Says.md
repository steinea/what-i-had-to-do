# The Last of Us Season 2 Won't Return to Bill and Frank, Executive Producer Craig Mazin Says

#### Let's be frank.

_**Spoiler Warning: The following article features spoilers for Season 1 of The Last of Us on HBO, up to and including Episode 3.**_

The Last of Us executive producer Craig Mazin has shut down a potential return of Season 1 standouts Bill and Frank, in Season 2 or elsewhere.

Speaking to [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-last-of-us-craig-mazin-bill-frank-return-season-3-nick-offerman-murray-bartlett-1235794364/), Mazin addressed comments made by Bill actor Nick Offerman earlier in January, who [joked about a return of the characters](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-nick-offerman-prequel-series-ideas) despite their deaths in Episode 3 of Season 1.

"It certainly has been pitched," Offerman said of a return. "I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other. It could be a musical. We’re not short on ideas. We’ll just we’ll see what Craig and [fellow executive producer Neil Druckmann] come up with."

But Mazin shut the idea down, making clear Bill and Frank won't return in flashbacks in The Last of Us Season 2, in a spin-off prequel, or elsewhere.

"I’m very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank,” he said. "There won’t be more Bill and Frank. Nick was joking about a prequel, that was kind of a joke. We are very happy with what we achieved."

Episode 3 of The Last of Us Season 1, the only one to include Bill and Frank, was considered a standout in [what was already a well-received adaptation](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review). "A masterfully told love story set in a world designed to leave them unwritten, Episode 3 of HBO’s The Last of Us is a sensational hour of television," [IGN said in our 10/10 review](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-review).

The ball is rolling on The Last of Us Season 2, with [Young Mazino](https://www.ign.com/articles/young-mazino-watched-all-the-last-of-us-cutscenes-like-a-movie-years-before-the-last-of-us-season-2-casting), [Isabela Merced](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two-will-feature-isabela-merced-as-dina), and [Kaitlyn Dever](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-finds-its-abby-in-kaitlyn-dever) joining the cast alongside Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey. [It will premiere on HBO in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-2025).
