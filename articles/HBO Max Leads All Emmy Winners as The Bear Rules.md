# HBO Max Leads All Emmy Winners as ‘The Bear’ Rules

#### This year, the conglomerate did not designate if a show was made for HBO proper or its streamer, Max, instead grouping its nominations under the moniker of “HBO Max,” per the TV Academy.

There’s “[HBO](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/hbo/) Max” and then there’s everyone else.

On the backs of _Succession_ and _The Last of Us_, HBO and its streaming counterpart Max led the [list of winners](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/2023-emmy-award-winners-list-1235788451/) at Monday’s 75th annual Primetime Emmy [Awards](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/awards/). While the TV Academy ceased breaking out wins by platform, _The Hollywood Reporter_ tallied up all the trophies from two nights of Creative [Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/emmys/) as well as the Primetime ceremony and the Warner Bros. Discovery-backed HBO and Max easily topped rival Netflix with 31 statuettes.

Streaming giant Netflix finished second — again — with 22 wins thanks in large part to _Beef_’s sweep of the limited series category. John Landgraf’s Disney-backed cable network FX delivered an impressive year with 16 wins, with _[The Bear](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/the-bear/)_ sweeping in the comedy category and leading all winners in awards that represent TV’s best from 2023. The ceremony, telecast on Fox, was delayed from September to January as a result of the writers and actors strikes.

On the programming side, _The Bear_ led all winners with 10 for its breakout first season. The dark comedy from creator Christopher Storer and exec producer Joanna Calo picked up the top comedy prize as well as wins for stars Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.

Netflix’s _Beef_ finished second with eight wins including in the limited series category and for stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong. HBO’s rookie drama _The Last of Us,_ which led all winners following two nights of the Creative Arts, was shut out during the primetime ceremony but still finished in third place. Fellow HBO hit _Succession_ finished in fourth place with six, including wins for best drama, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen.

On the conglomerate front, WBD submitted all of its programming as “HBO Max” titles as the TV Academy permits companies to designate the platforms as they see fit. (HBO originals air concurrently on Max, it’s worth noting.) Disney, however, thanks to _The Bear_ and FX/Hulu’s _Welcome to Wrexham,_ as well as ABC’s _Dancing With the Stars_ and _Elton John_ _Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium_ on Disney+, actually topped WBD with 36 combined wins when tallying up wins from across the company’s portfolio including ABC, Hulu, Disney+ and National Geographic.
