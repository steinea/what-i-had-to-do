# Laura Bailey, Pedro Pascal Celebrate Kaitlyn Dever's The Last of Us Abby Casting

#### The Last of Us TV show has found its Abby, and she's getting a warm welcome from the TLOU family.

[HBO's The Last of Us has found its Abby in Kaitlyn Dever](https://www.ign.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-finds-its-abby-in-kaitlyn-dever), and she's gotten the blessing of everyone from Abby's game voice actor Laura Bailey to the show's Joel and Ellie.

In fact, Bailey, who originated the character in The Last of Us Part 2, [was one of the first to roll out the welcome mat on X/Twitter.](https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/1744792300784656852)

"Huge congrats, Kaitlyn! So excited to see Abby’s evolution in your performance! Let me know if you want a workout buddy."

Given how buff Abby is in The Last of Us Part 2, Dever might want to take her up on that.

Of course, Bailey wasn't the only one to welcome Dever to the show. Pascal, who plays Joel in the show, was less wordy, but no less elegant. He posted a picture of Dever on Instagram story with the raised hands emoji. Appropriate, given that Joel is a man of action, not words.

And Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie, shared a warm welcome as well. "Welcome my friend @kaitlyndever," Ramsey wrote.

The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann, who also executive produces and writes on the HBO show, [tweeted his congratulations](https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1744767383217242503), writing "Welcome to the TLoU fam, [@KaitlynDever](https://twitter.com/KaitlynDever)! Stoked to collaborate with you again!"

As he hints at, Druckmann previously worked with Dever on Uncharted 4, in which she voiced the character Cassie.

The news of Dever's casting broke earlier today. In a joint statement, series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann said, "Our casting process for season two has been identical to season one: we look for world-class actors who embody the souls of the characters in the source material. Nothing matters more than talent, and we’re thrilled to have an acclaimed performer like Kaitlyn join Pedro, Bella and the rest of our family."

There's not much other news on Season 2 of The Last of Us yet, though the series has enjoyed a very successful awards season thus far. The series was [nominated for several Emmy Awards](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-won-eight-times-during-night-one-of-the-75th-creative-arts-emmy-awards), with Nick Offerman winning Outstanding Guest Actor and Storm Reid taking Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series at the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend. The series was also nominated for Outstanding Drama Series, Lead Actor (Pascal), and Lead Actress (Ramsey) at the Primetime Emmys, which take place next week. IGN considered it one of the [Best TV Shows of 2023](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-shows-2023).

The Last of Us Season 2 is currently scheduled to [air in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-2025).
