# Don’t Worry, Your PS4 Platinum Trophy Will Transfer Over to The Last of Us 2 Remastered on PS5

#### All it takes is one clicker.

The Last of Us 2 developer Naughty Dog has confirmed players’ earned Platinum Trophy in the PlayStation 4 original will transfer over to [The Last of Us 2 Remastered](https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered).

In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1745868362868310172), the developer confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is getting new trophies as part of the roguelike mode, dubbed No Return. (Check out [IGN’s hands-on preview with No Return here](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-roguelike-mode-no-return-hands-on-preview).)

However, your previously earned The Last of Us 2 trophies on PS4 will transfer over to Remastered on PS5, including your earned Platinum. The news will come as some relief to those who don’t fancy putting in all that work again to earn the Platinum, although I imagine there will be some out there who quite fancy taking on The Last of Us 2's Platinum Trophy challenge once again.

Naughty Dog also provided a list of all the new The Last of Us 2 Remastered trophies available from the No Return mode:

- Mixed Bag: Get kills with 5 different weapons in an Assault encounter
- Become The Hunter: Kill 12 enemies in a Hunted encounter
- Got Your Back: Win a round of Holdout without your ally falling below 70% health
- Burglar: Open the safe in Capture without killing any enemies
- Roll Call: Win a run with every character
- Modded: Complete an encounter with each Mod
- Risk Taker: Complete 5 gambits in one run
- Good Riddance: Beat all bosses
- Team Ellie: Complete all Ellie faction challenge tracks
- Team Abby: Complete all Abby faction challenge tracks
- True Strength: Get an S rank on an encounter
- May Your Survival Be Long: Win a Daily Run of No Return
- May Your Death Be Swift: Win a Daily Run of No Return on Grounded Difficulty

No Return trophies are not required to earn a Platinum Trophy in The Last of Us 2 Remastered, Naughty Dog clarified. Existing owners of The Last of Us 2 on PS4 can upgrade to a digital version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered for $10 at launch.

In our [10/10 review of the original game](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review), IGN said: "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way."

The Last of Us 2 Remastered comes out on PS5 on January 19.
