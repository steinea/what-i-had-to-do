# It Won't Surprise You to Learn _Succession_ and _The Bear_ Lead the 2024 SAG Nominees Too

#### HBO and Netflix racked up the nominations this year, with nods for The Last of Us, The Crown, and more.

Late in 2023, with both the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA on strike, it looked like awards season would be completely derailed. But now it’s January, and things are definitely back on track. The Golden Globes — middling host aside — kicked things off on Sunday, and now we’re less than a week out from the 2024 Emmys ceremony. It’s also time for actors to laud each other’s performances, with the Screen Actors Guild announcing the 2024 nominees Wednesday morning (after some technical difficulties — such is the life of Instagram Live).

After providing a necessary boost to movie theaters this summer, _Barbie_ and _Oppenheimer_ obviously lead the film categories. Similarly, the TV categories are dominated by clear frontrunners like _Succession_ and _The Bear_, both of which cleaned up at the Globes last weekend. It’s another good year for HBO, as _The Gilded Age_, _The Last of Us_, and _Barry_ also got some love.

There were some surprising omissions: Jeremy Strong, the SECOND eldest Roy Boy, was left out in the cold, while his fellow cast members were all nominated in their respective categories. Guess he’ll have to console himself with the ensemble win (which _Succession_ has locked down). But it’s great to see Bel Powley, who led Nat Geo’s _A Small Light_, get some recognition, along with Kathryn Hahn, who was a force in Hulu’s _Tiny Beautiful Things_.
