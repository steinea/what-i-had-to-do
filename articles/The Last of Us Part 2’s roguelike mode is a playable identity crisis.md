# The Last of Us Part 2’s roguelike mode is a playable identity crisis

#### Maybe The Last of Us Part 2 is better without a story

[The Last of Us Part 2](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence)’s No Return is so good it makes you wonder why Naughty Dog even bothered with making a story. A bonus mode that comes with [_The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered_](https://www.polygon.com/23966207/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps5-remastered-leak-psn), No Return transforms the acclaimed 2019 game into a full roguelike experience. It’s a well-rounded, engrossing rework that shows off the game in a new light, while also underlining the identity crisis at the heart of Naughty Dog: the version of the studio that excels at top-flight action-adventure games, and the Naughty Dog that strives to tell uncompromising, mature interactive stories.

Unlike the [recent, similar roguelike experiment](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001843/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-review-roguelite-free-dlc) from Sony Santa Monica’s [_God of War: Ragnarök_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23438548/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-ps4-release-date), No Return has no narrative justification. It’s a pure arcade experience: You select your difficulty, your character — each with their own playstyle — and any available modifiers, and try to make it as far as you can, until you die and start all over again.

Roguelike fans and the roguelike-curious [haven’t been hurting for options](https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23313023/best-roguelikes-on-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc) for a very long time now, but big-budget, marquee dalliances in the genre are still quite rare. No Return is more than an expensive novelty, though — the mode is a challenging yet accessible approach to roguelikes that shows off every flavor of _The Last of Us Part 2_’s tense, violent action by breaking it into pieces, relishing in the multiplicity of options and all the satisfying fiddly bits for upgrading weapons and characters present in the main game.

A generous cadence of unlockable characters, costumes, and game modifiers keeps adding variety in the early going, even if you spend your first few runs eating shit — a vital way to avoid the biggest roguelike hurdle, which is demanding mastery before doling out rewards. Juxtaposed so much more closely together, the different feeling of controlling Ellie, Abby, and others is more pronounced, making character selection feel like more than an aesthetic choice. Each character has a different starter weapon and upgrade track (Abby, for example, lets you upgrade melee abilities from the jump) with others doled out as rewards for progress.

Divorced from the weight of its story, you get a different appreciation of what _The Last of Us Part 2_ is: a tremendous, tense, and muscular stealth-action thriller, wholly committed to the visual language of desperation and the violence it elicits. Without story context, _The Last of Us Part 2_ is still quite remarkable four years on for how carefully it labors toward a cinematic verisimilitude, taking prestige video game murder to its logical endpoint in a way not really seen since _God of War 3_.

If this were done on purpose, I imagine it might cause Naughty Dog’s labelmates at PlayStation Studios to hang their heads in shame and try something else, something less ugly. But instead it’s a diversion, a “value add” to justify a $10 upgrade or $70 purchase. That common practice, of “adding value” — to help justify the re-release of a video game by adding more game to it — is interesting here in particular. The original 2020 release sought to follow up on the legacy of the “[greatest video game story ever told](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23552202/last-of-us-greatest-video-game-status),” to tell an uncompromising and brutal tale about the wages of revenge and the rot it causes to fester in one’s soul. The systems used by the game to that end are remarkable — the physical, awful ugliness of death and fear and tribalism, and all that comes with it.

In this it is tremendously effective, so much so that its [well-regarded HBO adaptation](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23547254/last-us-review-hbo-tv) may never truly live up to what the games have accomplished. Even if [you find the things _The Last of Us Part 2_ has to say reprehensible](https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/30/21307200/the-last-of-us-2-controversy-critics-press-naughty-dog-vice-review-leak-sony-ps4-playstation) — and I am not convinced they are not — its efficacy in using the language of games to say them is notable.

Herein lies the tension: if _The Last of Us Part 2_ is a carefully crafted, well-funded argument for blockbuster games as a pop-cultural equivalent to prestige television, then No Return is the version of _The Last of Us Part 2_ content to simply be a video game. It is the purest expression of the game’s systems — a grounded and raw set of unobtrusive, nesting mechanics that have the player see-saw between the adrenal fear of being prey and the intoxicating thrill of predation.

Wrestling with and contextualizing these impulses in No Return involves the player in _The Last of Us Part 2_ without making them complicit in a narrative — a clichéd trope that funnels a text’s possible interpretations into a combative bottleneck, distracting from a work’s intent by jabbing a finger at the person engaging with it. Eventually in _The Last of Us Part 2_’s story, a bill will come due as it has in many games before it, from _Metal Gear Solid_ to _Hotline Miami_: the question of what all those badass stunts you pulled off in playing the game were _for._

No Return doesn’t bother with this. In fact, it offers a pretty simple answer to the question of what all the violence is for: It’s the chance to put Ellie in an astronaut suit. Or Abby in a T-shirt, advertising another Sony game.
