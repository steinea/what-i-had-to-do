# HBO’s The Last of Us has found its Abby

#### Kaitlyn Dever to play the foil in season 2 of TLOU

[Season 2 of HBO’s _The Last of Us_](https://www.polygon.com/23634196/last-us-season-2-release-date-cast-news) will star Kaitlyn Dever as Abby Anderson, the antagonist (and playable protagonist) of the video game _The Last of Us Part 2_, [HBO](https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1744765981065654576) and developer [Naughty Dog](https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1744766416350560360) announced Tuesday.

Dever will join returning cast members Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie in the next season of HBO’s adaptation of the post-apocalyptic video game series.

A Golden Globe and Emmy nominee, Dever is best known for her roles in films like [_Booksmart_](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/23/18627608/booksmart-review-olivia-wilde-beanie-feldstein-kaitlyn-dever) and [_No One Can Save You_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23884006/no-one-will-save-you-movie-review), and TV series _Justified_ and _Dopesick_. She also appeared in Naughty Dog’s [_Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End_](https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/5/11540948/uncharted-4-review-a-thiefs-end-ps4-playstation-4-naughty-dog-nathan-drake) as [Cassie](https://www.polygon.com/23578101/uncharted-5-ps5-ad-naughty-dog-cassie-nathan-drake), daughter of Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher.

Abby in [_The Last of Us Part 2_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence) was portrayed by longtime Naughty Dog collaborator and veteran voice actor Laura Bailey — who made a brief cameo in season 1 of HBO’s _The Last of Us_ as a nurse in the final episode, “Look for the Light.” Abby’s in-game appearance was [based on two other women](https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/1/21309926/the-last-of-us-part-2-abby-body-actor-naughty-dog-ps4-playstation-sony-body-diversity): face model Jocelyn Mettler and athlete Colleen Fotsch. The fictional events of _The Last of Us Part 2_ also led to [the women who portrayed Abby being harassed by supposed fans](https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/6/21314543/the-last-of-us-2-harassment-neil-druckmann-laura-bailey-naughty-dog-abby-death-threats-ps4) of Naughty Dog’s games, including numerous death threats against them.

The role of Abby will be a crucial one to the story of season 2 (and possibly season 3) of _The Last of Us_. The story of Naughty Dog’s sequel, set years after the original game, focused on the repercussions of Joel and Ellie’s choices in the first chapter; players [experienced the resulting conflict from two perspectives](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/8/21316392/last-of-us-2-reviews-spoilers-ellie-joel-abby-ending-revenge), playing as both Ellie and Abby over the course of _The Last of Us Part 2_’s lengthy story.

Season 2 of _The Last of Us_ does not have an announced release date, but likely won’t arrive until 2025. It’s unlikely to be the final season, especially if it maintains the success of the first. Show creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have said the remaining story of _The Last of Us_ will span “more than one season.”
