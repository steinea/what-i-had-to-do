# The Last of Us Won Eight Times During Night One of the 75th Creative Arts Emmy Awards

#### The Bear, Wednesday, and The White Lotus all placed second during the show with four wins each.

HBO's The Last of Us was the big winner during night one of the 75th Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony, as it won eight times for such categories as outstanding guest actress (Storm Reid), guest actor (Nick Offerman), picture editing, main title design, prosthetic makeup, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects.

While The Last of Us led the way, FX's The Bear, Netflix's Wednesday, and HBO's The White Lotus all impressed by securing a three-way tie for second place with four wins each.

The Bear won for outstanding comedy casting, picture editing, sound editing, and sound mixing. Wednesday took home the awards for outstanding contemporary costumes, contemporary makeup, main title music, and production design. Lastly, The White Lotus claimed outstanding drama casting, contemporary hairstyling, music supervision, and music composition for original score.

Netflix's BEEF came in third with three Emmys, including outstanding casting for a limited or anthology series or movie, contemporary costumes, and picture editing. Right behind BEEF sat four shows with two wins each - Daisy Jones & The Six, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Ted Lasso, and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.

The second night of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards kicks off tonight, January 7, and the main ceremony - the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards - will take place on January 15, 2024. If The Last of Us can win at least one Emmy during the main show, it will be the first live-action video game adaptation to do so.
