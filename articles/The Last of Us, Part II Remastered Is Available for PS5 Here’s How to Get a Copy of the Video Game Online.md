It also has a new mode called “No Return, A Roguelike Survival Mode” that deepens combat and adventure with new paths and options for a different experience on the PS5.

When it was originally released in June 2020 for the PS4, “The Last of Us, Part II” received nearly universal acclaim scoring a [93 on Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered/) as a story continuation of the first game, which was released in 2013. Although a small minority of people didn’t like the new direction of the sequel, most critics and gamers enjoyed the new story and adventure, while developing and deepening the existing characters and world.

In fact, _Variety_ editor Katcy Stephan gave the new [remaster a rave review](https://variety.com/2024/gaming/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-1235867182/) writing, “Just minutes into playing, it becomes clear exactly why the remaster is the definitive version of this game. Playing in fidelity mode on PS5, which features native 4K performance, I gasped at the opening shot of Joel’s weathered hands on his guitar. A new level of staggering detail is present in every one of his wrinkles and callouses as he wrestles with the neck of his instrument.”
