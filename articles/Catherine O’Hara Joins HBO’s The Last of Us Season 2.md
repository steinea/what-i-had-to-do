# Catherine O’Hara Joins HBO’s _The Last of Us_ Season 2

#### The _Schitt’s Creek_ star joins the zombie apocalypse in an undisclosed role

The roster for the [second season](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-season-two-everything-we-know-1850225281) of HBO’s [_The Last of Us_](https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496) grows bigger every day. The latest actor to jump on board the critically acclaimed adaptation of Naughty Dog’s series of games is Catherine O’Hara of _Beetlejuice_ and _Schitt’s Creek_ fame. She’ll be joining returning leads Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, along with Kaitlyn Dever who is taking the [role of Abby](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428).  

The official announcement came via the [Max Twitter account](https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1753478399341813884) following an appearance by O’Hara on _Watch What Happens Live_ in which O’Hara responded “yeah” to a fans question about rumors she was in discussion for a role in _The Last of Us_ season 2. O’Hara also jokingly replied by saying, “How do you know these things?” Rumors of O’Hara’s involvement first surfaced on January 29 from [reporter Daniel Richtman](https://twitter.com/DanielRPK/status/1752014624696717517).

As to who O’Hara will play in Season 2, that is currently being kept under wraps. Unlike other high-profile casting news for Season 2, such as Dever’s casting as Abby, O’Hara’s role remains a mystery. When looking through the plot of _The Last of Us Part 2_ for a hint at who she could be playing, there aren’t any big parts that stick out. The more likely scenario is that she will be playing a character original to the TV adaptation. One of the biggest (and best) departures the first season of HBO’s _The Last of Us_ made from its source material was the addition or expansion of characters with minor connections to Joel and Ellie’s story. A standout example was the third episode, [“Long, Long Time,”](https://kotaku.com/last-us-hbo-show-bill-frank-neil-druckman-craig-mazin-1850048289) starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett. The most likely scenario is that O’Hara will get to headline her own episode that shows off her dramatic chops. Season 2 is scheduled to begin shooting this month.
