#  _The Last Of Us Part II_ Is Finally Getting Its Making-Of Documentary

#### _Grounded II_ will go behind the scenes of the 2020 sequel

Back in 2013, Naughty Dog released a documentary about the making of _The Last of Us_ called [_Grounded: Making The Last of Us_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5MgEbBOps). It was originally included as part of the game’s season pass, then later released online. It’s a great documentary. Sure, it’s a bit of a puff piece, but it’s still one of my favorite gaming documentaries. After four years, _The Last of Us Part II_ is finally getting an equivalent, and it’s coming out real soon.  

_Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II_ will launch on YouTube and as a downloadable add-on to [_The Last of Us Part II Remastered_](https://howl.me/cluP6n0cVzf) on February 2 at 12 p.m. ET. If you download the update for the game, you’ll also get new skins for Ellie and Abby to use during the campaign and the new [roguelike mode No Return](https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-roguelike-no-return-remaster-ps5-1851153264).
