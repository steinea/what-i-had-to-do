# HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 Finds Its Abby in Kaitlyn Dever

#### Rising star from Booksmart and No One Will Save You will take on a key role from The Last of Us Part 2.

"Our casting process for season two has been identical to season one: we look for world-class actors who embody the souls of the characters in the source material," series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann said in a joint statement. "Nothing matters more than talent, and weâ€™re thrilled to have an acclaimed performer like Kaitlyn join Pedro, Bella and the rest of our family."

The official release did not offer any additional information about The Last of Us Season 2.

Dever, for her part, is a rising star who broke out in Justified and Last Man Standing. She has also had major roles in Dopesick, Booksmart, and this past summer's No One Will Save You.

The Last of Us is coming off a successful season that has seen it [tipped for numerous Emmy awards](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-won-eight-times-during-night-one-of-the-75th-creative-arts-emmy-awards), with Storm Reid getting the win as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series and Nick Offerman winning Outstanding Guest Actor at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys. It's up for Outstanding Drama Series, Lead Actor (Pascal), and Lead Actress (Ramsey) at next week's Primetime Emmys. It was also nominated for [Best TV Show of 2023 on IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-shows-2023), but ultimately lost out to Succession.

Mazin and Druckmann have been offering coy updates on The Last of Us Season 2 since last year, confirming among other things that the [first episode was written before last year's WGA strike](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-co-creator-keep-season-2-on-track-2025-release-amid-strikes). Mazin has also said that the series ["should be around for a while"](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-says-hbo-series-should-be-around-for-a-while-beyond-season-2) after Season 2, and both [Offerman](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-nick-offerman-prequel-series-ideas) and Mazin have [hinted at potential spin-offs in the proper circumstances](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-isnt-against-spin-offs-if-they-make-sense).

The Last of Us Season 2 is currently slated to [kick off in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-2025). For more, check out all of the biggest TV shows coming in 2024.
