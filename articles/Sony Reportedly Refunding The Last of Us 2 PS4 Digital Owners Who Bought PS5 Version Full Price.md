# Sony Reportedly Refunding The Last of Us 2 PS4 Digital Owners Who Bought PS5 Version Full Price

#### As a gesture of goodwill.

Sony appears to be refunding customers who own the PlayStation 4 digital version of The Last of Us 2 and who bought the PlayStation 5 remaster at full price.

A message circulating online shows the offer of a refund in that specific circumstance, pointing out the $10 upgrade path currently available. The message reassures customers they will receive any pre-order bonuses included in the original pre-order.

According to some PlayStation owners, [The Last of Us 2 Remastered](https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered) on the PlayStation Store appears unavailable to those who own the PS4 version, but this was not always the case, potentially leading to purchases of the PS5 version by those unaware of the upgrade.

The Last of Us 2 Remastered launches today, January 19, on PS5. In our [10/10 review of the original game](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review), IGN said: "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way."
