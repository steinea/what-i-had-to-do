# Creative Arts Emmys: ‘The Last of Us’ Tops Night One Ceremony

#### 'The White Lotus,' 'The Bear' and 'Wednesday' also collected four awards apiece at Saturday's presentation.

HBO’s post-apocalyptic drama _The Last of Us_ topped night one of the [2023 Creative Arts Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/2023-creative-arts-emmys-winners-list-night-two-1235780934/) presentation with eight [awards](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/awards/), in the categories for guest actor, which was presented to Nick Offerman for his role as Bill; guest actress, for Storm Reid, who played Riley; editing; main title design; prosthetic makeup; sound editing; mixing and VFX.

The Television Academy started to hand out its Creative Arts [Emmy Awards](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/emmy-awards-2/) Saturday, which will continue Sunday at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live, after being pushed from its September window due to the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

Also during Saturday’s ceremony, HBO’s _The White Lotus_, FX’s _The Bear_ and Netflix’s _Wednesday_ collected four awards apiece. _The White Lotus_ won [Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/emmys/) for music supervision, casting, hairstyling and score. _Wednesday_ collected trophies for costumes, makeup, main title music and production design. _The Bear_ won awards for casting, editing, sound editing and mixing.

Collecting three Emmys apiece were _BEEF_ (casting, costumes and makeup) and the final season of _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_ (cinematography, makeup and a juried award for motion design).

Roku’s _Weird: The Al Yankovic Story_ won the Emmy for outstanding TV movie, as well as an additional award for music composition. With the win for a TV movie, Yankovic now has an Emmy and Grammy Award, halfway to EGOT.

Ed Sheeran won his first Emmy, for _Ted Lasso_’s “A Beautiful Game” in the category for original music and lyrics. The singer/songwriter, who wasn’t in attendance, is now halfway to EGOT, having previously won four Grammys.

Tim Burton collaborator and Grammy winner Danny Elfman, also not in attendance, is additionally halfway to EGOT with a win for _Wednesday_’s main title music.

Additional winners include four-time Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood, who collected her second Emmy, for longtime collaborator Burton’s _Wednesday_. Atwood’s Academy Awards include one for Burton’s _Alice in Wonderland_.

Guest acting awards went to Judith Light, for her role as Irene Smothers in _Poker Face —_ which is also Peacock’s first Emmy win — and Sam Richardson for his role as Edwin Akufo in _Ted Lasso_. Jasmine Guy grabbed an Emmy for actress in a short form project, for _Chronicles of Jessica Wu,_ while Tim Robinson won the actor in a short form project Emmy for various characters in _I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson._

_The Last of Us_‘s Offerman and Murray Bartlett (who was also nominated for guest actor) opened Saturday’s ceremony, with Bartlett acknowledging the Emmy’s 75th anniversary, saying it is “the only anniversary we should be celebrating on Jan. 6.”

Offerman noted that the [Creative Arts Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/creative-arts-emmys/) are about “creatives whose hard work makes the shows that entertain millions of people around the world,” quipping that it’s not about “showboating actors.”

The delay due to the Hollywood strikes moved the entire event — including the televised Emmy Awards on Monday, Jan. 15 — into Oscar season and, in the case of Sunday’s Creative Arts Emmys, up against the Golden Globe Awards. Emmys judging remained on its original schedule; voting closed last summer.

HBO’s [_Succession_ entered the ceremony with 27 nominations](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/2023-emmys-nominations-nominees-list-1235533766/), the most for a series, followed by HBO’s _The Last of Us_ (24) and _The White Lotus_ (23) and Apple TV+’s _Ted Lasso_ (21).

Sunday’s presentation will generally focus on categories in reality, nonfiction and variety programming.

Previously announced [winners in juried categories](https://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/75th-juried-winners-231206) including animation, costume, hair styling, make-up and motion design will also be presented this weekend.
