# Nick Offerman Says Ideas Have Been Pitched For Bill & Frank Return On ‘The Last Of Us’

[Nick Offerman](https://deadline.com/tag/nick-offerman/) is taking home his first Emmy Award on Saturday night, winning the gold statuette for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Bill in HBO’s _[The Last of Us](https://deadline.com/tag/the-last-of-us/)_.

Offerman was tight-lipped as to whether or not Bill and his small screen love Frank, played by fellow Guest Actor nominee Murray Bartlett, could return next season even if it’s only in flashback form.

“Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself,” he said backstage. “It certainly has been pitched. I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other. It could be a musical. We’re not short on ideas. We’ll just we’ll see what Craig [Mazin] and Neil [Druckmann] come up with,” Offerman added jokingly.

Whether or not that happens, Offerman reveals he would love to reprise the role.

“Oh sure,” he said about his interest. “I was lucky this time. They needed a guy who could use a shovel. Three of us in Hollywood, Harrison Ford passed and Jane Lynch was not available.”

_The Last of Us_ leaves the first night of the [Creative Arts Emmy Awards](https://deadline.com/tag/creative-arts-emmy-awards/) with 8 golden statuettes, the most of the night. In addition to Guest Actor in a Drama Series, Storm Reid won Guest Actress in a Drama Series, with the show also winning Emmys for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup, Visual Effects, Main Title Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Picture Editing.
