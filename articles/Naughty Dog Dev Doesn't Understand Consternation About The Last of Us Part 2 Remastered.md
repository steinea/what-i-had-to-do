# Naughty Dog Dev Doesn't Understand 'Consternation' About The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered

#### "If it’s not for everyone, that’s fine."

[The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered](https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered) is the best way to play the beloved Naughty Dog sequel, said director Matthew Gallant, who doesn't understand fans' "consternation" around its announcement.

Gallant was asked by [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-director-explains-why-the-ps5-upgrade-is-worth-it/) why he thought video game remasters like this one are often met with backlash from the community. The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered was criticised for arriving on PlayStation 5 less than four years after the original launched on PlayStation 4, with Naughty Dog offering current owners an upgrade for $10 when it comes out on January 19.

But Gallant said he doesn't get some of the "consternation", meaning dismay or distress, surrounding its release. "I don’t understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered offers," he said. "It’s the best way to play The Last of Us Part 2.

> I don’t understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered offers.

"If you’re a new PlayStation owner and new to the franchise we want to get you the best experience with all the hardware features on a PS5 native version of the game. My sense is there’s an audience for this for whom the idea of a PS5 version is thrilling. I’m also speaking for myself. I’m excited we can bring this to the fans, and if it’s not for everyone, that’s fine."

The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered includes a roguelike mode called No Return, Lost Levels with developer commentary, graphical enhancements, DualSense integration, and a Guitar Free Play mode.

The Lost Levels — which were cut from the original game but are being included as bonus content for the PlayStation 5 upgrade — are called Jackson Dance, Boar Hunt, and Sewers, [the last of which has fans particularly worried](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-lost-levels-revealed-and-fans-are-already-spooked).

In our [10/10 review of the original game](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review), IGN said: "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way."
