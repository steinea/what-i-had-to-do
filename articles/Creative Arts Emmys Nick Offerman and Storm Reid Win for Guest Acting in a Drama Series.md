# Creative Arts Emmys: Nick Offerman and Storm Reid Win for Guest Acting in a Drama Series

#### Both stars were recognized for their work in 'The Last of Us' at Saturday night's ceremony.

[Nick Offerman](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/nick-offerman/) and [Storm Reid](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/storm-reid/) were big winners at the [2023 Creative Arts Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/2023-creative-arts-emmys-winners-list-night-one-1235780689/) on Saturday, winning guest actor and actress in a drama series, respectively.

Nick Offerman, winning for _[The Last of Us](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/the-last-of-us/)_, was nominated against Murray Bartlett (_The Last of Us_), James Cromwell (_Succession_), Lamar Johnson (_The Last of Us_), Arian Moayed (_Succession_) and Keivonn Montreal Woodard (_The Last of Us_).

Reid, also recognized for her work in _The Last of Us_, was nominated alongside Hiam Abbass (_Succession_), Cherry Jones (_Succession_), Melanie Lynskey (_The Last of Us_), Anna Torv (_The Last of Us_) and Harriet Walter (_Succession_).

Reid, accepting from presenter Ernie Hudson, was in tears for her speech, telling the crowd, “I’m such a mess. 30 seconds is just not enough time!” before thanking her team, family and friends, with a special shoutout to her mother. “This is proof you can do anything. I’m just a young girl from Atlanta, Georgia,” she concluded, with huge applause from the audience. It was Reid’s first win and first nomination.

In accepting his award, Offerman noted, “Fortune presents gifts not according to the book” and gave a special nod to fellow nominee Bartlett for their partnership in _The Last of Us_‘ breakout episode. He also thanked his wife Megan Mullally and added, “We would not be doing anything but standing around with our thumbs up our asses if [showrunner] Craig Mazin hadn’t written the most beautiful script I’ve ever been handed.” The win was Offerman’s first Emmy after four nominations.

_The Last of Us_ landed 24 nominations at this year’s [Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/emmys/), including outstanding drama series and recognition for stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey.

The two-day Creative Arts ceremony, which was delayed from September to January following the writers and actors strikes, is handing out nearly 100 (mostly technical) TV [awards](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/awards/) ahead of the televised Primetime Emmys broadcast on Jan. 15. An edited presentation of the [Creative Arts Emmys](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/creative-arts-emmys/) will air Jan. 13 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on FXX.
