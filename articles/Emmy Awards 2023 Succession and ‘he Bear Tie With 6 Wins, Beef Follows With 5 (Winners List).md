# Emmy Awards 2023: ‘Succession’ and ‘The Bear’ Tie With 6 Wins, ‘Beef’ Follows With 5 (Winners List)

Three shows dominated the 2023 Emmy Awards on Monday night: “[Succession](https://variety.com/t/succession/),” “The Bear” and “Beef.” Each show nearly swept its respective category in the drama, comedy and limited series races. “Succession” and “The Bear” tied with a leading six wins each, and “Beef” followed closely with five trophies.

Hosted by Anthony Anderson, the 75th Emmy Awards on Fox provided multiple tributes to hit shows of the past, as well as the present. The casts of series like “Cheers,” “The Sopranos,” “Ally McBeal,” “Martin” and more reunited for the night, while former cast members of show’s like “Grey’s Anatomy” and the ever-Emmy-ignored comedy “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” took the stage to present awards.

The audience in attendance also gave plenty of love to [presenter and nominee Christina Applegate](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/christina-applegate-cries-emmys-standing-ovation-presenter-1235872757/), who previously stated she is all but done with on-camera work due to multiple sclerosis. The crowd also got to its feet for Niecy Nash-Betts [during her acceptance speech](https://variety.com/2024/awards/news/niecy-nash-betts-emmys-speech-dahmer-monster-1235872966/) for her work in “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.”

“Succession” won outstanding drama series, and stars Kieran Culkin (lead actor in a drama), Sarah Snook (lead actress in a drama) and Matthew Macfadyen (supporting actor in a drama) each won awards. Writer and creator Jesse Armstrong and director Mark Mylod each won for the “Connor’s Wedding” episode, in which Waystar Royco CEO Logan Roy dies. The show also won outstanding drama series.

“The Bear” won outstanding comedy for its first season, with Jeremy Allen White (lead actor in a comedy), Ayo Edebiri (lead actress in a comedy) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (supporting actor in a comedy) took home prizes. Creator Christopher Storer also won for writing and directing.

“Beef” won outstanding limited series. Its stars Steven Yeun (lead actor) and Ali Wong (lead actress) won awards, plus creator Lee Sung Jin earned honors for writing and directing.

HBO led the way among all networks with a trio of hit shows, “Succession,” “[The Last of Us](https://variety.com/t/the-last-of-us/)” and “The White Lotus.” The final season of the Roy family drama topped all shows with 27 nods, followed by HBO’s adaptation of the popular zombie apocalypse video game with 24 nominations and Season 2 of Mike White’s vacation nightmare series with 23 nods.

The comedy category was led by Apple’s supposedly final season of “Ted Lasso,” which earned 21 nominations. Netflix’s “Beef” and “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” tied in the limited or anthology series categories with 13 nods each.
