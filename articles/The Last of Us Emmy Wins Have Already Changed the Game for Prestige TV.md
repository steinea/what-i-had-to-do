# _The Last of Us_ Emmy Wins Have Already Changed the Game for Prestige TV

#### The apocalyptic series has officially proven that great television can emerge from the video game world.

_The Last of Us_ has [already shattered](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/creative-arts-emmys-2023) the prestige ceiling for TV shows based on video games. After the early “creative arts” ceremony, the HBO series was already a multiple Emmy winner going into Monday night’s prime time telecast, having claimed eight trophies out of its total 24 nominations. Five more top categories are still to be presented live: best drama series, best drama directing, outstanding writing for a drama, and lead-actor and actress nods for stars [**Pedro Pascal**](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/pedro-pascal) and [**Bella Ramsey**](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/bella-ramsey-hit-parade)**.**

Even if it wins nothing from the remaining categories, the vast slate of nominations and advance trophies for _The Last of Us_ raises the bar for gaming adaptations, which have struggled to mine critically acclaimed drama and characters from even the most popular interactive titles. The apocalyptic series, about survivors in an American wasteland after a fungi-based parasite turns the majority of humans into voracious, brain-dead zombies, is based on a game first created by Naughty Dog in 2013 for PlayStation 3.

It could be argued that the game itself introduced a new level of dramatic narrative, adapting a cinematic style and distinctive characters who fit naturally into the structure of a TV series. Many of the characters and situations featured in the show were taken directly from the game, including the lonely-hearted, gun-toting prepper Bill, played by **Nick Offerman,** who won best guest actor in a drama this year. (His costar in the episode, **Murray Bartlett**—who played Frank, a stranger who the gruff survivor comes to love—was also nominated in the category.)

Their rivals in the category included fellow _Last of Us_ guests **Lamar Johnson** and **Keivonn Montreal Woodard,** who played Henry and Sam, two desperate brothers whose tragic arc was also adapted directly from the game.  

_The Last of Us_ also won for best guest actress in a drama, with **Storm Reid** claiming the trophy for playing Riley Abel, a friend and crush of Ramsey’s character. Also nominated were **Anna Torv,** who played Pascal’s self-sacrificing companion, Tess, and **Melanie Lynskey** as cold-blooded cabal leader Kathleen. Reid’s and Torv’s characters were both introduced from the gaming storylines, while Lynskey’s was a new addition. 

The show’s [other early Emmy wins](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.emmys.com/shows/last-us) include drama series editing, sound editing, sound mixing, title design, visual effects, and prosthetic makeup.

_The Last of Us_ was created by _Chernobyl_ producer and showrunner **Craig Mazin** and the game writer and creative director **Neil Druckmann.** “When we were making _The Last of Us,_ we had already started working on games in a way that was pretty different for big-budget games in that we put story first,” [Druckmann told](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/01/the-last-of-us-game-creators-parents-can-finally-experience-his-work) _Vanity Fair_’s **Natalie Jarvey** last year when the show debuted.

“Back then, you’d have designers creating really fun encounters or fun setups, and then story would come in, like, ‘here are all these levels, write something to tie them all together,’” Druckmann continued. “I think that’s why we got pretty poor stories. Instead, we said with _The Last of Us_, which was the evolution of a lot of the work we did on _Uncharted,_ what if the whole thing was constructed around a relationship?”

That relationship—between the young girl Ellie (played by Ramsey) and the hard-bitten fighter and survivor Joel (played by Pascal)—not only made the players more invested in the survival horror game, but it made a strong translation to the screen. Ellie is a child without a family, and Joel is a grieving father who has never gotten over his own daughter’s death when the parasite took over humanity.

“At its core is the soul of it, the unconditional love a parent feels for their child,” Druckmann told _VF._ “When I started working with Craig, there’d be people asking me, ‘What were your demands, the things that Craig couldn’t change?’ I didn’t have to make that list because he just understood it fundamentally.”

Video games have historically struggled to find the dramatic through line necessary to turn otherwise exciting play skills into a narrative that can sustain a series. Even decades ago, the incessant dot-munching of Pac-Man led only to a [dimly remembered](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083461/) Hanna-Barbera cartoon from the early ’80s, and the more recent _Halo_ series on Paramount+ has [underwhelmed critics and viewers](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/halo) with its efforts to turn the first-person shooter into a sprawling space drama. (Netflix’s _The Witcher_ takes inspiration from a hit game series, but the games themselves were based on [the novels of **Andrzej Sapkowski**](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-Boxed-Set-Destiny-Contempt/dp/1473232279/ref=asc_df_1473232279/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=533520118460&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16336362955410645491&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031168&hvtargid=pla-917601211613&psc=1&mcid=780f6c710b2238dbbad13175d3c9d379&gclid=CjwKCAiA44OtBhAOEiwAj4gpOTqyzU3_5AY2E1u3SN7cLvRY_rGo20HPv7IPjns8u-23pqxtlEjLrBoCyeYQAvD_BwE)**.**)

With _The Last of Us_ leading the way, gaming may have cracked the formula for successful TV. Can this year’s _Fallout,_ a similar [end-of-the-world saga](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112181159/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/11/fallout-first-look) making the leap from hit game to (hopefully) must-watch television, keep the momentum going?

All that’s certain is that the bar for such adaptations has now been raised, elevated by the golden wings of the Emmy statue.
