# In great casting news, Catherine O'Hara joins _The Last Of Us_ season 2

#### Catherine O'Hara adds to the HBO drama's incredible lineup of new cast members for season 2

[_The Last Of Us_](https://www.avclub.com/what-did-you-think-of-the-last-of-us-season-1-finale-1850219216) continues to assemble a phenomenal ensemble for its upcoming season. After Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, and Young Mazino, HBO has announced [Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara](https://www.avclub.com/catherine-o-hara-on-moira-rose-s-unique-vocabulary-and-1844831853) is joining the post-apocalyptic drama, and what an inspiring choice it is. The _SCTV_ and _Schitt’s Creek_ actor is best known for her comedic roles, but _TLOU_ will allow her to flex her dramatic chops, at least if [Nick Offerman](https://www.avclub.com/the-last-of-us-nick-offerman-emmy-1850054719)’s first season performance and subsequent Emmy win is any indication. Moira Rose is about to be so proud.

Co-created by Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, [_TLOU_](https://www.avclub.com/tv/reviews/the-last-of-us-2023) is based on the popular video game of the same name. Set 20 years after a pandemic caused by a fungal infection, the show follows Joel (Pedro Pascal), who is tasked with transporting an immune teen, Ellie (Bella Ramsay), across the country. Along the way, they battle Clicker enemies who are both human and zombie. HBO is keeping O’Hara’s character details under wraps for now, but here’s hoping she gets to share charming banter with Pascal and Ramsay.

Season one already featured an impressive roster of guest stars, including Offerman, Murray Bartlett, Melanie Lynskey, Lamar Johnson, and Keivonn Montreal Woodard. So it’s not surprising the show continues to up the ante. So far, season two is set to introduce Mercad’s Dina as Ellie’s love interest, and _Beef_’s breakout star Mazino as a selfless community member named Jesse. Meanwhile, Dever is all set to play Abby, who seeks revenge for her father’s death at Joel’s hands.

As exciting as this cast is, brace yourself for a long wait time. _The Last Of Us_ will go into production at some point this year, which means season two will air _all the way_ in 2025. Hopefully, our patience is well-rewarded.
