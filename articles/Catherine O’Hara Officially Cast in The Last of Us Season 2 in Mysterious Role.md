# Catherine O’Hara Officially Cast in ‘The Last of Us’ Season 2 in Mysterious Role

#### The 'Schitt's Creek' actress has joined the growing list of actors joining the HBO hit.

Catherine O’Hara is entering the apocalyptic world of HBO’s _[The Last of Us](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/the-last-of-us/)_.

The _Schitt’s Creek_ and _Beetlejuice_ actress has been cast in season two in an undisclosed role.

O’Hara is joining a burgeoning cast of newcomers to the acclaimed series who include: Kaitlyn Dever (_No One Will Save You_), Isabela Merced (_Madame Web_) and Young Mazino (_Beef_).

Dever will star as Abby, a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved. Merced will portray Dina, described as “a free-wheeling spirit whose devotion to Ellie will be tested by the brutality of the world they inhabit,” while Mazino will portray Jesse, “a pillar of his community who puts everyone else’s needs before his own, sometimes at terrible cost.”

_TLOU_ is based on the critically acclaimed PlayStation video game and takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey, as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.

_TLOU_ [season two](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/the-last-of-us-season-finale-review-1235348142/) is expected to start production in the spring and will return to HBO in 2025.
