# Young Mazino Starts Filming ‘The Last of Us’ Season 2 in Two Weeks; He’s Learning ‘How to Ride a Horse’ and Brushing Up on Firearm Training

[Young Mazino](https://variety.com/t/young-mazino/) spoke to Marc Malkin during _Variety’s_ On the Carpet, presented by DIRECTV, about landing a highly-coveted role in HBO’s “[The Last of Us](https://variety.com/t/the-last-of-us/)” Season 2. The network [announced earlier this month](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-cast-young-mazino-jesse-1235866961/) the “Beef” breakout is set to star in the new season as Jesse, said to be “a pillar of his community who puts everyone else’s needs before his own, sometimes at terrible cost.” He joins fellow newcomers Isabela Merced and Kaitlyn Dever opposite returning favorites Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey. Mazino says he’s set to start filming the show in two weeks.

“After the strike ended, I was able to get a meeting with the showrunners and we kind of just shopped it up. I played the video game before the meeting and we had a long talk about their process and what they’re looking for. I guess ‘Beef’ pushed me the rest of the way. That’s the beauty of where I’m getting at now. It’s a conversation more than an audition process.”

Playing “The Last of Us” before his meeting with showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann was Mazino’s first real experience with the game. He called the game “phenomenal” and confirmed that his training for Season 2 includes learning “how to ride a horse” and brushing up on his firearm training.

“I haven’t met Pedro or Bella,” he added. “I have DM’d Bella, but I haven’t had the pleasure of talking to them, but I will soon.”

When asked if Ramsey gave him any advice on joining “The Last of Us” family, Mazino said, “There’s nothing I can say.” He concluded: “I am happy for me. Im so happy I can work again.”

Mazino attended the Emmys as a nominee for “Beef” in the outstanding supporting actor in a limited or anthology series or movie. The show landed a total of 13 nominations.
