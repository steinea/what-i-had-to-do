# 21 Games We Can’t Wait to Play in 2024

#### _Dragon’s Dogma_ makes its long-awaited return, Princess Peach dons pants, and more.

Can 2024 live up to one of the all-time-great video-game years that [preceded it](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104152804/https://www.vulture.com/article/best-video-games-2023.html)? In all likelihood, probably not. After all, 2023 was stacked with incredible, genre-defining titles like [_The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104152804/https://www.vulture.com/article/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-game-review.html), _Baldur’s Gate 3_, and [_Alan Wake 2_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104152804/https://www.vulture.com/article/alan-wake-2-review.html) partly because of the lingering effects of the global pandemic: Studios reorganized themselves and lengthened production cycles, thus pushing back release dates. 2024 probably won’t yield such a crop of Metacritic-topping titles, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to look forward to, especially considering the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles are entering their fourth year, which means game-makers should truly have a handle on the hardware. Expect long-in-the-works follow-ups to cult classics, innovative indies, and dazzling remakes that look set to improve on their originals. Throw in the anticipated release of the [Nintendo Switch 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104152804/https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games), which could arrive in the latter half of the year, and 2024 might not reach the dizzying heights of 2023, but that’s not to say it won’t keep us rapturously entertained.

## _The Last of Us Part II Remastered_ (PS5)

_PS5_  
_January 19_

A remaster for a game that was just released in 2020? Sure, you’re entitled to eye-roll at its inclusion on this list of most anticipated games. But wait! The remaster arrives with not only upgraded visuals but a handful of new game modes including roguelike survival. Most tantalizing is the inclusion of material that never made it into the final game: a handful of unfinished levels accompanied by commentary from key members of the dev team. At the very least, this remaster could offer fresh insight into the oftentimes impregnable fortress that is triple-A game development, even if it’s entirely on publisher Sony’s terms.
