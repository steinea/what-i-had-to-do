# Who the hell is Catherine O'Hara playing in _The Last Of Us_ season 2?

#### A comedy legend meets mushroom monsters and human depravity in the latest casting notice from HBO's _The Last Of Us_ show

We might soon be forced to contend with the mental image of [Moira Rose](https://www.avclub.com/tv/reviews/schitts-creek) blasting a fungus monster in the face with a shotgun, as [_Variety_ reports](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-cast-catherine-ohara-1235895477/) today that living legend Catherine O’Hara has been cast in a role in the still-brewing second season of HBO’s critically lauded video game adaptation [_The Last Of Us_](https://www.avclub.com/tv/reviews/the-last-of-us-2023). (Truly, the most terrifying concept we’ve contemplated since the days of _The Crows Have Eyes III: The Crowening_.) O’Hara is joining the series in an undisclosed role, which is the sort of thing that’s going to eat at us all day, honestly, because who the hell in [_The Last Of Us Part II_](https://www.avclub.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-boldly-reckons-with-its-predeces-1844043738) would be a good fit for comedic superstar Catherine O’Hara?

[As we’ve noted before](https://www.avclub.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-adaptation-hbo-season-2-plot-1851187421), the second season of Craig Mazin’s show faces some unique problems, most of them owing to the very tight links between the TV series and the video games that serve as its source material. (Neil Druckmann, creative director and one of the lead writers on the games, is closely involved with Mazin’s show.) We already know, for instance, that Kaitlyn Devers is playing “Abby” in the show’s second season—a character new to the TV series, whose role in the second game is so important as to elevate her to co-star status with Pedro Pascal’s Joel and Bella Ramsey’s Ellie.

The fact that they’re not saying who O’Hara is playing, meanwhile, suggests one of two possibilities: Either it’s a new character—similar to Melanie Lynskey or Murray Bartlett’s roles in the first season, which had only rough links to the original games—or it’s just a _completely_ wild pick. There is, for instance, a character in the background of _The Last Of Us Part II_ who’s referred to in-game only as “The Prophet,” a cult leader who took advantage of the mushroom apocalypse to seize control of a decent chunk of Seattle, turning it into a Luddite, fanatical nightmare. (You can kind of see it, right? O’Hara, mixing beatific and manic, handing out death sentences? We can see it, in our heads.)

This is all just speculation, though; the only thing we _really_ know is that _The Last Of Us_ is not a world with a ton of room for comedy, silliness, or light, which means, we’re absolutely fascinated by the idea of O’Hara being transplanted into it. (She’s largely resisted the urge to take a classic comedian “let’s get dramatic” swing in her career, although she did co-star in the semi-comedic [_Pain Hustlers_](https://www.avclub.com/pain-hustlers-movie-review-1850931526) last year.)

The second season of _The Last Of Us_ is expected to arrive on TV some time in 2025.
