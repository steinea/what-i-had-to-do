# Emmys Kick Off With Big Night for _The Last of Us_

#### The Television Academy held the first event for the 75th annual Emmys on Saturday night.

It's been a long road to the 75th annual Emmy Awards. Nominations [were first announced](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/07/emmy-nominations-2023-list) last July, but the writers and actors strikes delayed the event, which was originally planned for September of last year. But now the folks behind TV's presumable best and brightest have three awards shows to attend, starting with night one of the Creative Arts Emmys, which focused on scripted programming and was held on Saturday. (Night two is Sunday, and will cover reality, unscripted, and documentary programming.)Â 

The Creative Arts awards are often seen as an early indicator of what might win at the Primetime Emmys. That event, which will be broadcast at 8 p.m. ET on Fox, will be held on Monday, January 15. If Saturday's results are any indication, mushrooms, red meat, and trauma-based cannoli will all be on the menu.

Of the 49 categories presented Saturday, video game-based HBO drama _The Last of Us_ was the top winner, with eight awards. (A full list of Saturday's winners [is available online](https://edit.emmys.com/sites/default/files/press/creative-240106-v1.pdf).) The dystopian fungal zombie series saw **Storm Reid** win for outstanding guest actress, while outstanding guest actor went to **Nick Offerman.** It was also nominated for picture editing, main title design, prosthetic makeup, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects.

FX dining destination _The Bear_, Netflix Addams Family spinoff _Wednesday,_ and black resort comedy _The White Lotus_ all took home four awards. _The Bear_'s wins were in outstanding comedy casting, picture editing, sound editing, and sound mixing. _Wednesday's_ honors were for outstanding contemporary costumes, contemporary makeup, main title music, and production design. T_he White Lotus_ won outstanding drama casting, contemporary hairstyling, music supervision, and music composition for original score.

Other winners in acting categories included _Ted Lasso_'s **Sam Richardson,** who took his first Emmy home for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series; **Judith Light** was named outstanding guest actress in a comedy for the Peacock's _Poker Face._

In the short form world, **Jasmine Guy** took home the outstanding actress award for Prime Video's superhero series _Chronicles of Jessica Wu_, while **Tim Robinson** won outstanding actor for his Netflix sketch series _I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson._ (Given Robinson's award, does this count as a win for cult fave sitcom _Detroiters_? Technically, no, but in many fans' hearts, it's surely a yes.)

On Sunday, January 7, 48 more categories will be honored for unscripted primetime TV, then on Monday, January 15, 26 more categories, as well as the Television Academy's Governors Award, will be awarded.
