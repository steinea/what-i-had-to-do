# _The Last of Us_ Just Made Another Smart Casting Decision

#### If it worked last year...

_[The Last of Us](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-last-of-us-review-hbo)_ was lauded for faithfully adapting its source material, lifting whole scenes directly but also [adding backstory](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-last-of-us-episode-3-director-peter-hoar-interview) to minor characters and introducing new ones when necessary. Now, as production ramps up on Season 2, new casting announcements are shedding light on just how closely the second go-around will cover _The Last of Us Part II._

The latest announcement may seem like a strange choice for a post-apocalyptic prestige TV series, but it follows a smart example from Season 1. [_Variety_](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-cast-catherine-ohara-1235895477/) reports that _The Last of Us_ Season 2 will feature _Beetlejuice_ and _Schitt’s Creek_ star Catherine O’Hara in an undisclosed role. Unlike the previous casting announcements of Isabella Merced, Young Mazino, and [Kaitlyn Dever](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever), it’s not immediately clear who she’s meant to play.

There’s no clear role from the game O’Hara could play. Much like Melanie Lynskey, who played militant Kansas City rebel [Kathleen](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/last-of-us-episode-4-villain-kathleen-abby) in Season 1, O’Hara could be playing a new character created to add more context to the post-apocalyptic landscape than the initial game provided.

If so, _The Last of Us_ is continuing to not just adapt its source material, but augment it. In moving from a game to a show, viewers miss out on the extra immersion of being able to control a character. Adding more depth to the world is the perfect way to compensate.

Regardless of O’Hara’s role, this is a sign _The Last of Us_ hasn’t lost sight of what made the first season work. _Part II_ is far more complex to the point where it can’t be contained to [one season](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-last-of-us-season-2-more-zombies), but the same basic formula should be effective. Catherine O’Hara may feel like an odd pick for such a brutal series, but Nick Offerman was also known mainly for his comedic roles, and he broke hearts in a Season 1 episode full of original material. In Season 2, we may just see if that success is repeatable.
